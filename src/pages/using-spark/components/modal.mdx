# Modal

The Modal component is a dialog that
is displayed on top of all site content.
When a Modal is present, the rest of
the site is inactive and covered by a
mask overlay. Modals are by definition an
interruption of the current user flow
(they put the page into a new "mode").

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="modal--default-story"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
  minHeight="25rem"
/>

### Usage
A Choice Modal poses a question to the
user and allows them to take an action.
Use a Modal when you need the user to
enter a new flow before they continue
their current task, or to provide additional
contextual information about the current task.
For example, you could use a modal to get confirmation from
the user before deleting a record, or to display a
critical error message before continuing the
task at hand. Keep in mind that modals will
always interrupt the current user task and
should not be used if such an interruption is
not desired. Research shows that mandatory
interruptions are very detrimental to productivity.

### Guidelines
- Spark Modals can be fully-controlled using a mouse, keyboard,
  and/or screen reader.
- Modals can be closed by pressing the "Escape" key, clicking the Cancel button
  (in the Choice variant), clicking the Close icon (in the Choice or Info variants),
  or clicking the mask overlay (in the Choice or Info variants). Wait variant
  modals must be closed programatically.
- The Modal and mask elements are hidden by default.
- If the content in the Modal is too large for the viewport
  then the Modal will show a scroll bar.
- When the Modal is opened, the first focusable element
  inside the Modal will receive focus.
- While the Modal is open, focus is "trapped" inside the
  Modal. Pressing the Tab or Shift+Tab keys to move focus
  will only shift focus between the elements in the Modal.
- When the Modal is closed, focus will be returned to
  the element that last had focus before the modal was opened.
- The trigger element should always be outside the Modal container.
