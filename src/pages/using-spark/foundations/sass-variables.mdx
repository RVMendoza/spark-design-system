# Sass Variables

Spark uses Sass to provide global settings for the design system.
These settings allow users of Spark to have an application
that looks and feels the same as all other Spark applications.
This keeps a cohesive experience and ensures quality standards
are met. However, because Spark uses Sass variables
there is the opportunity to override those settings
if the use case should occur. To override Spark settings,
a new Sass file will need to be created and imported before the main Spark
Sass file import. In that new file, any of the the below variables
can be reset with a new value.
